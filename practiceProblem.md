This page has example Capture the Flag examples.  There will be more added every week leading to the competition.


The goal of each problem in a Capture the Flag event is to find a "flag" that solves each problem.  A flag consists of a string of text that contains random words.  The flags in this competition will always appear in the following format:

AUCTF{some_random_words}


Solutions will be released when new problems are added.
